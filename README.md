Creating a proper README file for your project is a great idea! Here's a template you can use to get started:

# Code Refactoring Project

This project aims to refactor a medium-lengthy page with too much UI and functionality into a more readable and maintainable format. The original code is placed in the `before` folder, while the refactored code is in the `after` folder.

## Folder Structure

- `before`: Contains the original code snippet before refactoring.
- `after`: Contains the refactored code split into components and hooks.

## Files

- `page.tsx`: Main file containing the `BurnPage` component.
- `BurnButtonBar.tsx`: Component for the burn button bar.
- `BurnStatsContainer.tsx`: Component for displaying burn stats.
- `TransactionTable.tsx`: Component for the transaction table.
- `ChainSelector.tsx`: Component for selecting token chains.

## Custom Hooks

- `useWallet.ts`: Custom hook for managing wallet-related state.
- `useChainSelector.ts`: Custom hook for managing chain selection state.
- `useAppSupplies.ts`: Custom hook for managing app supplies state.
- `useCoinData.ts`: Custom hook for fetching and managing coin data.
- `useTransactions.ts`: Custom hook for managing transaction-related state.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MayurCode2/Task-Fragmentation
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. View the original code in the `before` folder and the refactored code in the `after` folder.

## Why Fragmentation?

The code was fragmented into components and hooks to improve readability and maintainability. This allows for better organization and reusability of code, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the refactored code as a reference for your own projects.
